## Jour 390: API and data portal dive labs 
This repository contains an API from the Chicago Data Portal. The URL
for the dataset used is https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/dpt3-jri9. 

Using basic transformations, in `CPD_driving_arrests.R`, I looked at the number of arrests where 
the most serious charge (charge 1) involved driving and found the 
percentage of these arrests as compared to how many arrests there 
are in the dataset. 

I also included some data exploration for the data portal dive lab
in the R script `data_portal_diversions.R`.
